So I just say “fuck it lemme take this lady’s order cause she’s already being a bitch”. I proceed to take the order. She says “GIMME A CARAMEL FRAPPE EXTRA CARAMEL NOT NO DRIZZLE SHIT I WANT THE DAMN PUMPS” and I said okay and asked her if it looked correct on the screen but she drove off and didn’t bother staying at the box to hear my response. (Customers live in their own world and we don’t matter to them I guess). She pulls up to the window and is shaking her head at me and tells me “you’re nasty” and I said “excuse me?” She says “you have a mask on and you have those blue gloves on and you’re touching the money then touching the drinks?” And I told her “no I don’t make your drinks ma’am I just cash you out and hand them to you that’s all” she said “yeah well that’s still nasty af and gross” I told her “it’s like that everywhere ma’am the person who grabs your payment is the same person who hands you your drink” she said “no it ain’t” at this point I knew she just wanted to fight with someone but I told her “I switch the gloves a lot throughout the day and still wash my hands and I even sanitize the gloves after every car.” And I showed her the box of gloves and my sanitizer wipes/hand sanitizer. She took the drink from me and told me I was disgusting and nasty, then told me “and your touching my drink fucking gross ass” and sped off. Idk if she was mad cause I had a mask on and gloves, idk what her issue was.

In my case, the gear shifter on my package car. I theorize that, that motion for the past 3 years has ultimately ruined my right shoulder. My shoulder is only inflamed when I am at work, and mostly when I push that little button in on the selector, and push down to go to Drive, or vice versa to Park/Reverse. I was off for 2 weeks straight on vacation and 95% of my pain was diminished. By day 3 of my return to work, I had that 95% of my shoulder pain back. I had an MRI done today. I’ve been thru physical therapy, the whole 9 yards. Now I’m waiting for the call from my doctor to translate my MRI results. I’ve never reported an injury to UPS (never had one honestly), so I’m definitely unsure of how something like this would work. Should I lawyer up now? If I report it tomorrow I feel like that would make no sense. “Hey, yea so I’ve been hurting for over a year in my shoulder and it’s from the repetitive use of the gear shifter, I’m reporting this injury now”.

I’m 10+ years in driving so it goes in one ear and out the other at this point. He didn’t like my lack of enthusiasm and started getting loud, aggressive, in my face and got close enough that he touched my hand that I was holding up to keep him at a distance. The minute his torso made contact with my hand he accused me of pushing him, went crazy screaming don’t touch me and then walked  me to the office where it was just him and the building manager in the office. When they came out they fired me then and there for workplace violence. I called to make a police report shortly after thinking if police got involved they would force UPS to show some type of proof but it did nothing for me as I work in a ‘Right to work state’. They got a part time sup and a driver who basically works as an hourly supervisor to lie for him. There were “no cameras working” that day on that side of the building, allegedly and I ended up losing 4 months of pay because of it. Ended up getting my job back, no back pay but 4 months is still 4 months. One of the worse things about that situation was that another driver, who happened to be walking with one of the lying “witnesses” as this happened saw that the supervisor was the aggressor and he didn’t step up and tell the truth. Guys like that are what weakens unions and gives the company that advantage to be weasels and snakes. 3 people should’ve lost their jobs after that incident for their tremendous lack of integrity and lying to police when they interviewed UPS after I spoke to them. Ugly situation that I just wanted to get off my chest. Let me know anything any of u might’ve done in that situation, thanks.\n",

However, if the employee was terminated without notice or with incomplete notice, they may not be rehirable. The author also suggests that employees should not feel guilty about leaving and should consider their own career goals and financial opportunities. Overall, the information suggests that Dollar Tree is a flexible employer that can accommodate employees' needs and schedules, but ultimately, rehiring is at the discretion of the store manager.  There is no specific information on what happens if an employee is rehired, but it is mentioned that employees who are rehired often come back to work with better hours.
